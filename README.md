# bedsite-data

# Sample of bedsite data to play around with and compare site selection to paired random sites. Type is used (1) or random (0) and there are two random sites per used # # bedsite. I haven't been using Year in the model but have it in the data in case; it shouldn't affect anything. Habitat has 5 categorical variables included, elevation, # slope, ruggedness, and distance to water are continuous, and the rest of the variables are percentages. I'm planning on using AIC in the future to select the best #model from these variables.
